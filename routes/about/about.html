            <p>
                <b>gophysics is a set of Physics formulas and constants with the porpuse of simplifying calculations.</b>
                It is written using the <a href="https://go.dev/">Go programming language</a>, and it is currently a non-stable release.<br />
                It covers fields such as Classical Physics, Gravitation, Fluid Dynamics, Thermodynamics, Electromagnetism and Relativity.
                <br />
                The project was developed by me, Gabriele Gatti, an italian Computer Science student with the passion for Physics.<br />
                The idea was to create a tool to help other students like me who may struggle in making complex calculations.
                <br /><br />
                <h4>Why Go?</h4>
                I'm really enjoying my experience with this amazing, simple but powerful, programming language.
                One key aspect of choosing Go was having multi-output functions, which means functions that can return more values at once even 
                of different types. Infact when you use the library each function will return the value and the measurement unit.
                <br />
                Also, as it is rising in popularity, I believe that Go deserves to have more math or Physics related functions.
            </p>
            <h3 id="help">How can I help?</h3>
            <p>
                If you have any suggestion for improving the library you can send an issue in the 
                <a href="https://github.com/Gabri432/gophysics/issues/new">Github repository</a>, 
                also if this project has been helpful to you consider putting a star, so that more people can participate and use the library.
                <br />
                If you want to add a new feature check how to do that by following the 
                <a href="https://github.com/Gabri432/gophysics/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md">Contribution Guide</a>.
